This component allows you to track and control various light bulbs.

It has [4 built-in light profiles](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/master/homeassistant/components/light/light_profiles.csv) which you're able to extend by putting a `light_profiles.csv` file in your config dir.

Preferred way to setup the Philips Hue platform is through the [the discovery component]({{site_root}}/components/discovery/). For the Wink light platform enable [the wink component]({{site_root}}/components/wink/).

If you want to enable the light component directly, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
light:
  platform: hue
```

<p class='note'>
The light component supports multiple entries in <code>configuration.yaml</code> by appending a sequential number to the section: <code>light 2:</code>, <code>light 3:</code> etc.
